My name is Ivan D Vasin. This is my website.

## About this site

This website is a [single-page application] written mostly in [**Elm**] with a
bit of [**TypeScript**], styled with [**Tailwind CSS**] and the [**Catppuccin**
color schemes], and built with [**Parcel**]. It is deployed on the
[**Firebase**] platform, using [**Firebase Hosting**] for web hosting and
[**Cloud Functions**] for [serverless] backend functionality.
