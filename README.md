My name is Ivan D Vasin. This is my website.

## About this site

This website is a single-page application written mostly in [Elm] with a bit of
[TypeScript], styled with [Tailwind CSS] and the [Catppuccin color schemes], and
built with [Parcel]. It is deployed on the [Firebase] platform, using
[Firebase Hosting] for web hosting and [Cloud Functions] for serverless backend
functionality.
